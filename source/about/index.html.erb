      Michelle is a Product Designer in the Bay Area.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in the Northwest, where I grew up surrounded by artwork and evergreens. I have an urban planning degree, and my former career consisted of running farm tours and sipping signature cocktails (ok, that last part was just a job perk).
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy minimalism in life, but like a lot of color when I design. Iâ€™m slowly turning into my mother, who also uses Vim on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
    I currently live in the Bay Area with my husband, <a href="https://twitter.com/jatescher" target="_blank">Julian</a>, and work as a product designer at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a>.
