At thoughtbot, we use design sprints when trying out scope and brainstorm
direction for new ideas and products. The concept is adapted from [Google
Ventures], and is a 5-day structure that helps answer business questions through
design activities, prototyping, and user testing. All of thoughtbot's design
sprint structure is available on [Github].

While I've mostly used sprints to scope and brainstorm directions for products,
the structure of a sprint can be used for all kinds of problems. Recently, I
worked with a small group of designers at thoughtbot to create a coaching
program, and we used a sprint to validate the initial idea and scope out the
best way to get the program up and running.

I detailed our process of completing the sprint, including how we used user
interviews, activities like [crazy eights], and more on the thoughtbot blog
recently.
