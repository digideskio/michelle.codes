It wasn’t until I moved to California that I realized most citrus is best in the
winter. While fruits like oranges do well in cold storage, citrus tends to peak
and be freshest in winter months. I used to think of oranges and lemons as
summer fruits, but now the orange displayed in a Japanese New Year kagami mochi
makes a lot more sense.

I’m sad to see citrus slowly leaving the markets. It’s already hard to find
meyer lemons and limes. As a goodbye, I created this blood orange and meyer
lemon cocktail, which is nicely set off with a thyme-infused simple syrup. You
could make it with a valencia or a navel, but you can’t beat the red color. Come
to think of it, this would be a pretty great holiday cocktail! I’ll have to keep
that in mind for when December rolls around.

#### Blood Orange & Thyme Cocktail

You can use any sort of simple syrup for this cocktail, but it's especially good
with thyme.

__Ingredients__

- 1 blood orange, juiced
- 1/2 a meyer lemon, juiced (can substitute with any kind of lemon)
- 1 ounce thyme simple syrup (1 cup sugar, and about 15 sprigs of thyme. Full recipe here.)
- 1 1/2 ounces vodka
- Optional: ice cubes, especially ones with something colorful frozen inside.
- Garnish: A slice of orange, lemon, or thyme sprig.


__Thyme Simple Syrup__

- Rinse thyme to remove any dirt or sediment.
- Boil 1 cup water.
- After the water reaches a boil, turn off heat, add sugar, and stir until it's fully dissolved.
- Pour sugar water into a bowl.
- Add the thyme sprigs to the bowl, pushing into the water as much as possible with a utensil. It's fine if some of the sprigs stick out of the water.
- Leave thyme in the sugar water for 40 minutes to steep. Taste at the end - you can leave it in longer, but 40 minutes should do the trick.
- Take out the thyme sprigs, straining if necessary to remove any large pieces.


__Assemble Cocktail__

- Measure all ingredients into a drinking glass.
- Taste test and adjust as necessary.
- Feel free to add ice cubes and any garnish you like. I added a sprig of golden lemon thyme and a blood orange slice.
