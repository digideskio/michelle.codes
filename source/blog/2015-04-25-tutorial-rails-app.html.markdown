I love how interactive web apps can be, and the amount of creativity and control
you can have over a system when you know how set it up as an app. However, if
you’re new to the process of creating web apps, sometimes all the moving pieces
can be a bit overwhelming. In this tutorial I’ll be walking through my basic
process of getting an app up and running.

## Tools I Use

Here are the tools you’ll need to complete this tutorial: Terminal, Rubymine,
Ruby on Rails, Git, Github, Heroku, and Heroku Toolbelt. An old fashioned is
optional.

## Ruby On Rails And Github

Ruby on Rails is a great framework that is fantastic for quick prototyping. It’s
a favorite of mine when doing small projects with an even smaller team, since it
allows for a quick development cycle.

GitHub is a service that hosts your versioned code, helps you collaborate on
projects, and provides the ability to view and participate in open source
projects. You don’t technically need to use Github, since Heroku will host your
git repository for you, but if you want to collaborate with other people Github
is very useful.
