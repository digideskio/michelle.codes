This year, I was fortunate enough to go through Codepath's [iOS for
Designers](https://codepath.com/) bootcamp, where I learned the ins-and-outs of
Xcode, created animations in Swift, and even learned how to hook up Parse and
create fully-working apps. You can read more about my thoughts about using Xcode as
a designer on the [thoughtbot
blog](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/xcode-as-a-prototyping-tool-for-designers).

After a few weeks of regular homework assignments where we prototyped existing
apps, we all split into small groups and built our own apps. My group created an
app called MiniMeet, which lets people create small, intimate meet-ups about any
topic at any time. We got to
present at final demo day as one of the top three apps.

I'll be writing up a case study on our app soon, but wanted to share a couple of
visuals of MiniMeet.
