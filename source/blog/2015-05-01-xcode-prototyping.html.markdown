There are a lot of prototyping tools out there for designers. Some of the tools
I've used in the past include Pixate, After Effects, and Flinto, all of which provide
different ways for designers to show interaction and test their designs.

However, after completing Codepathâ€™s [iOS for Designers bootcamp](https://codepath.com/iosfordesigners), I've started using Xcode as a prototyping tool for many projects. There are a few reasons why I think
it can be a great process for designers working on iOS projects to get comfortable with.

#### 1. Designers benefit from understanding app development

By using the same tool that engineers use to build apps, designers can become
more comfortable with terminology, app architecture, and general constraints
involved in building apps. All of this facilitates communication between
designers and engineers, and informs the entire design process.
