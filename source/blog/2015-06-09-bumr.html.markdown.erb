I recently was given the opportunity to work 

One fun example of user research in action was the onboarding process. The client wanted users to tap on an "explore" label that appears at the bottom of the sign in screen, but every single user failed to see it upon opening the app. Users also expressed a lot of affection for the cat character that appeared once in the app, but it also wasn't very present.

My solution was to incorporate the "fun" aspect of the app that users already liked - the cat - and use animation to draw attention to the "explore" option on the main screen.
